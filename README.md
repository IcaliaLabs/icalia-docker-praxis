## About Mentors

We recommend you to identify the available platform mentors in the team so whenever you find a
problem regarding Docker and the development technology your'e using, you know the right person to
help you with your issue:

## About our team's workstation OS diversity

We do want our team members to use their operative system of choice (Linux, MacOS or Windows*),
whenever it is possible. Each team member is responsible to notify the appropiate mentor about any
problem found. The following considerations *must* be followed to allow collaboration from the rest
of our team members, regardless of their workstation OS of choice:

### Docker for Mac

#### General Considerations

* ENSURE THE `**/*.DS_Store` LINE IS INCLUDED IN THE `.gitignore` FILE! (and any other ignore files)

### Docker for Linux

TODO: Put something

### Docker for Windows

#### General Considerations

* Docker for Windows will only work for Windows 10 Pro, which contains the Hyper-V hypervisor.
